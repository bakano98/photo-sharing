# Things to Do

1. UI should allow viewing of photos in order by name. There should be a forward/backward button that allows the user to move between each photo.
1. Create admin UI to allow some sort of user management system

- Viewing of those which are "pending". This is to allow for approval and setting them to active status.
- Button to re-generate access codes for only _active_ users

1. Bring online? Test cloud storages?
